This application consists of three main pages for user authentication and information management:

- Login Form: Allows users to log in.
- Sign Up: Enables users to create a new account. (Note: This Endpoint is for practice purposes only and does not create real user accounts.)
- User Info: Displays user information and provides a logout option
